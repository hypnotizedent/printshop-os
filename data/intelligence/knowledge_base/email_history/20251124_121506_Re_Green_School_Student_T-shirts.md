Hi again,

It turns out a different department within my teams want this shirt quote, so I'm going to copy their assistant here. @Anna Trinidad<mailto:antrinid@fiu.edu>, You can work with this wonderful team to put together Stephany's t-shirts!

MintPrints/Ronny, I'll probably follow up with you about a similar design with some other ideas my supervisor had in mind.

Hi Ronny,

I hope you're doing well. My apologies for never getting back to you with the stoles. We're fine for now on that front, one way or another. I have a different problem now but nothing to do with your production.. I'll confront that later!

I was hoping to design a t-shirt for general student use using the logo's attached. The classic full "FIU Steven J Green..." logo on the front in one of the corners like t-shirts usually have logos, and the newer more rectangular one larger across the middle of the back. I know I had talked about this second set of shirts before, but it's been so long I can't remember where I left off!

Please let me know if your wonderful team can help me put this together.

Thank you!
