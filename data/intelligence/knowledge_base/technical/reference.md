## Garment Care Instructions
All garments should be washed inside-out in cold water. Tumble dry low or hang dry. Do not iron directly on prints. For embroidered items, avoid bleach and harsh detergents.

## Print Methods Comparison
- **Screen Printing:** Best for large orders, vibrant colors, durable.
- **DTG (Direct-to-Garment):** Ideal for complex designs, small batches, photo-quality.
- **Heat Transfer:** Quick turnaround, works on various materials.
- **Embroidery:** Premium look, very durable, best for logos.

## Color Matching Guidelines
We use Pantone color matching for accuracy. Monitor colors may vary from printed results. Request a color swatch for critical color matches. CMYK converts to closest Pantone equivalent.
