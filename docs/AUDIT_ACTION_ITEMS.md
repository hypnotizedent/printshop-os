## 2. Test Coverage Inventory

**Parent:** Repository Audit → Code Quality  
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Effort:** ~4-6 hours

Create a detailed test coverage inventory for each service to identify gaps and establish baseline metrics.

### Current Test File Count

|---------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `services/api` | 13 | ~100+ | Jest | ⏳ Needs inventory |
| `services/job-estimator` | 6 | ~50+ | Jest | ⏳ Needs inventory |
| `services/production-dashboard` | 4 | ~75+ | Jest | ⏳ Needs inventory |
| `services/supplier-sync` | 1 | ~10+ | Jest | ⚠️ Low coverage |
| `frontend` | 2 | ~20+ | Vitest | ⚠️ Low coverage |
| `printshop-strapi` | 4 | ~30+ | Jest | ⏳ Needs inventory |

### Template for Test Coverage Issues

```markdown
### Service: `{service-name}`

#### Current State
- Test files: {count}

- Coverage tool configured: {Yes/No}

#### Test Inventory
| Test File | Type | # Tests | Key Coverage |
|-----------|------|---------|--------------|
| {file.test.ts} | Unit/Integration | N | {description} |

#### Coverage Gaps
- [ ] {Area not covered}
- [ ] {Missing edge cases}

## 4. Documentation Consolidation

**Parent:** Repository Audit → Single Source of Truth  
**Priority:** 🟢 Low  
**Effort:** ~2-3 hours

Resolve duplicate and overlapping documentation to maintain single source of truth.

### Duplicate Documentation Identified

| # | Files | Issue | Resolution |
|---|-------|-------|------------|
| 4.1 | `ARCHITECTURE.md` vs `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` | Different perspectives on architecture | Keep both - different scopes (implementation vs. overview) |
| 4.2 | `docs/architecture/*.md` files | 5 files that may overlap with root ARCHITECTURE.md | Review for consolidation |
| 4.3 | Multiple session summary files | 8+ session files in docs/ARCHIVE_2025_11_27 | Archive or delete |

### Documentation Consolidation Sub-Issues

| # | Issue Title | Description | Priority |
|---|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 4.1 | Clarify ARCHITECTURE.md vs ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md | Add cross-references, define scope of each | Low |
| 4.2 | Review docs/architecture/ folder for consolidation | Merge or archive redundant files | Low |
| 4.3 | Remove stale session summary files | Clean up 8+ session reports in archives | Low |

### Files to Review in `docs/architecture/`

```
docs/architecture/
├── SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md     ← May overlap with SERVICE_DIRECTORY.md
├── ai-integration-guide.md      ← Unique - keep
├── component-architecture.md    ← May overlap with ARCHITECTURE.md
├── system-overview.md           ← May overlap with ARCHITECTURE.md
└── data-flow.md                 ← May overlap with ARCHITECTURE.md
```

## 5. Archive Cleanup

**Parent:** Repository Audit → File Organization  
**Priority:** 🟢 Low  
**Effort:** ~1-2 hours

Clean up archived and legacy files to reduce repository bloat.

### Archive Directories

| Directory | Files | Size | Last Modified | Action |
|-----------|-------|------|---------------|--------|
| `docs/ARCHIVE_2025_11_26/` | 16+ | ~200KB | Nov 26, 2025 | Review for deletion |
| `docs/ARCHIVE_2025_11_27/` | 48+ | ~700KB | Nov 27, 2025 | Review for deletion |
| `docs/legacy/` | 3 | ~50KB | Nov 2025 | Review for deletion |

### Archive Cleanup Sub-Issues

| # | Issue Title | Description | Priority |
|---|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 5.1 | Review and clean docs/ARCHIVE_2025_11_26 | Archive is 3+ days old - consider removal | Low |
| 5.2 | Review and clean docs/ARCHIVE_2025_11_27 | Archive is 2+ days old - consider removal | Low |
| 5.3 | Review docs/legacy folder | Contains old pricing-tool-reference and website-roadmap | Low |

### Archive Cleanup Decision Matrix

| Keep If | Archive If | Delete If |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Referenced in current docs | May be useful for reference | No external references |
| Contains unique information | Historical value only | Superseded by newer docs |
| Active development dependency | Learning/post-mortem value | Duplicate information |

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for branch analysis
      
      - name: Run Audit
        run: ./scripts/audit.sh
      
      - name: Upload Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
