## 🚀 Next Steps for Your Team

### Immediate (Day 1-2)
1. ✅ Review `SUPPLIER_INTEGRATION_EPIC.md` 
2. ✅ Review Epic #85 on GitHub
3. ✅ Verify all original issues are consolidated
4. → Create sprint backlog from 11 sub-tasks

### Short Term (Week 1)
1. → Assign team members to parallel work streams:
   - **Team A:** Infrastructure (normalization, transformation)
   - **Team B:** Caching & error handling
   - **Team C:** S&S Activewear integration (largest API)

2. → Create detailed implementation tasks from sub-tasks:
   - Break each sub-task into 3-5 day sprints
   - Assign to individual developers
   - Set daily standup sync points

### Implementation (Weeks 1-4)
1. → Follow Phase 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 3.4 sequence
2. → Use code examples from epic as starting templates
3. → Reference success metrics for acceptance
4. → Update GitHub with progress in epic comments
