## 📅 Comprehensive Daily Log

### Day 1: November 21, 2025 (Friday) - Project Inception

**What Happened:**
- Created printshop-os repository on GitHub
- Initial project structure with monorepo layout
- Set up basic Strapi CMS scaffolding
- Defined 4-service architecture:
  1. `services/api` - Central API for Printavo sync
  2. `services/job-estimator` - Pricing engine
  3. `services/production-dashboard` - Shop floor tracking
  4. `services/supplier-sync` - Supplier integrations

**Key Decisions:**
- Node.js + TypeScript only (no Python services)
- Strapi 4.x (later upgraded to 5.x)
- React 19 + Vite + TailwindCSS for frontend
- REST-only API (no GraphQL)

**Commits:** Initial commits, project setup

---

### Day 2: November 22, 2025 (Saturday) - Strapi + Data Architecture

**What Happened:**
- Installed Strapi CMS locally
- Created initial content types: customer, order, job
- Started Printavo API integration research
- Tested Printavo API endpoints

**Key Files Created:**
- `printshop-strapi/` - Full Strapi installation
- First content type schemas

**Printavo API Discovery:**
- Base URL: `https://www.printavo.com/api/v1`
- Auth: email + token as query params
- Endpoints tested: orders, customers, orderstatuses, products, tasks

---

### Day 3: November 23, 2025 (Sunday) - Repository Consolidation

**What Happened:**
- **MAJOR:** Discovered 4 separate pricing repos existed
- Consolidated all code into single printshop-os monorepo
- Total lines of code after merge: 51,969+
- Created Flexible Pricing Engine (PR #98)
- Created Workflow Automation (PR #99)

**Problems Identified:**
- Duplicate supplier-sync implementations
- Scattered documentation (218 markdown files)
- No single source of truth

**Key Decisions:**
- Adopted HLBPA pattern (High-Level Big Picture Architect)
- Maximum 10 markdown files in root
- All others go to `docs/` subdirectories

---

### Day 4: November 24, 2025 (Monday) - "Merge Hell" Day

**What Happened:**
- Attempted to merge 16 feature branches into main
- Resulted in 50+ merge conflicts
- Spent ~2 hours on conflict resolution
- Closed 7 duplicate issues
- Cleaned up 5 merged branches

**Problems Encountered:**
- Duplicate tracking in both GitHub Issues AND PRs
- Branches created for features that already existed
- Documentation sprawl causing confusion

**Post-Mortem Conclusions:**
1. Work on ONE branch at a time
2. Delete branches after merge
3. Issues for planning, PRs for implementation only
4. No session summaries or implementation reports

---

### Day 5: November 25, 2025 (Tuesday) - Enterprise Foundation

**What Happened:**
- Full repository audit completed
- Found 218 markdown files across project
- Identified 7 active services (later consolidated to 4)
- Archived legacy `services/api/supplier-sync/` to `docs/archive/`
- Established service inventory

**Repository Audit Results:**
- 40,710 files total
- 277+ commits
- 37 branches
- 854 markdown files
- Conclusion: "60% complete but 0% operational"

**MVP Gap Analysis Created:**
- Priority 1 (BLOCKER): Auth system, Quote workflow, Order creation
- Priority 2 (HIGH): Real-time tracking, Support API, Payments
- Priority 3 (MEDIUM): Production dashboard, Inventory

---

### Day 6: November 26, 2025 (Wednesday) - Auth System + Major Cleanup

**What Happened:**
- Deleted 26 stale branches
- Consolidated root docs to 10 files (HLBPA compliant)
- Implemented Phase 1-3 of MVP:
  - Customer signup/login
  - Employee PIN validation
  - 18 tests passing
  - Strapi auth routes working

**Auth Routes Created:**
- `/api/auth/customer/login`
- `/api/auth/customer/register`
- `/api/auth/employee/validate-pin`

**Documentation Cleanup:**
- Moved 200+ files to `docs/` or `docs/archive/`
- Created `docs/ARCHIVE_2025_11_26/`

---

### Day 7: November 27, 2025 (Thursday) - MAJOR DATA MIGRATION DAY

**What Happened (Morning):**
- Deployed Strapi to docker-host (100.92.156.118)
- Full Printavo data extraction completed
- All 3 supplier APIs verified working

**Printavo Data Extracted:**
| Data | Count | Size |
|------|-------|------|
| Orders | 12,867 | 61 MB |
| Customers | 3,358 | 3.8 MB |
| Line Items | 44,158 | 23 MB |
| Tasks | 1,463 | - |
| Expenses | 297 | - |
| Products | 105 | - |
| Statuses | 25 | - |

**What Happened (Afternoon):**
- Created import scripts
- Imported 3,317 customers (deduplicated)
- Imported 12,854 orders (all years, deduplicated)
- Cleaned duplicates: 2,485 customers + 1,331 orders

**Supplier APIs Verified:**
| Supplier | Auth | Status | Products |
|----------|------|--------|----------|
| AS Colour | Subscription-Key + JWT | ✅ | 522 |
| S&S Activewear | Basic Auth | ✅ | 211,000+ |
| SanMar | SOAP + SFTP | ✅ | 415,000+ |

**🚨 THE BIG DISCUSSION: 500 Products vs 400K Products**

We spent significant time planning how to handle the massive supplier catalogs:

**Problem:** 
- Printavo has 105 products (our historical orders)
- Suppliers have 600,000+ products combined
- Can't import all to Strapi (too slow, too large)

**Solution Agreed Upon:**
1. **Top 500 Products** - Pre-load in Strapi from Printavo order history
   - These 500 products account for 13,045 units ordered
   - Used for autocomplete and quick quote creation
   - Fast local queries

2. **Full Supplier Catalogs** - External storage with AI/agent access
   - Store in MinIO or external vector database
   - Use Pinecone (free tier) for semantic search
   - AI agent can query when asked "what products do we have in red?"
   - OpenAI embeddings for product descriptions

3. **Redis Caching** - 3-tier TTL strategy
   | Data Type | TTL | Rationale |
   |-----------|-----|-----------|
   | Product Info | 24 hours | Rarely changes |
   | Pricing | 1 hour | Can fluctuate |
   | Inventory | 15 minutes | Real-time critical |

**🗂️ MINIO FOLDER STRUCTURE (Hot Folder Architecture)**

We designed a complete file organization system:

```
printshop-artwork/                      # MinIO bucket
├── pending/                            # Awaiting customer approval
│   └── {order-id}/
│       ├── original/                   # As-uploaded files
│       └── converted/                  # Print-ready versions
├── approved/                           # Ready for production
│   └── {order-id}/
│       ├── screen-printing/            # Separated by print method
│       ├── embroidery/
│       ├── dtg/
│       └── metadata.json               # Colors, sizes, specs
├── in-production/                      # Currently on machine queues
│   └── {order-id}/
└── archive/                            # Completed jobs
    └── {year}/{month}/{customer-slug}/
        └── {order-id}/
```

**Machine Hot Folders (On Production Floor):**
```
/mnt/production/                        # NFS mount from docker-host
├── screenpro-600/                      # Screen printing machine
│   ├── incoming/                       # Files to print (synced from MinIO)
│   ├── processing/                     # Currently printing
│   └── completed/                      # Done (watched for auto-archive)
├── barudan/                            # Embroidery machine
│   └── incoming/                       # DST files
└── dtg-printer/
    └── incoming/                       # DTG-ready files
```

**AI Agent Integration Plan:**
- Agent receives query: "What red polo shirts do we have?"
- Agent queries Pinecone vector DB with embeddings
- Returns: "AS Colour 5101 in Burgundy, S&S Hanes 054 in Deep Red..."
- If customer orders, fetch real-time inventory from supplier API
- Cache result in Redis for 15 minutes

**What Happened (Evening):**
- Created artwork scraper v2: `scripts/printavo-artwork-scraper-v2.py`
- Started scraping artwork by customer folder
- ~4% complete when session ended

**Artwork Scraper Structure:**
```
data/artwork/
├── by_customer/                        # PRIMARY - for reorders
│   └── {customer-slug}-{id}/
│       └── {year}/{visual_id}_{nickname}/
├── by_order/                           # SECONDARY - symlinks
├── index.json                          # Searchable master index
└── checkpoint.json                     # Resume position
```

**Evening Session Extended:**
- Ran full artwork scrape overnight
- Morning result: 106,303 files, 205 GB, 9,307 orders, 2,661 customers
- Index generated: `data/artwork/index.json` (99,740 lines)

---

### Day 8: November 28, 2025 (Friday) - Session Continuity Crisis

**What Happened (Morning):**
- Discovered SSH connection instability to docker-host
- Multiple "Connection reset by peer" errors
- Realized AI memory loss between sessions causing repeated work

**Docker Update Issue:**
- Attempted to restart Docker on docker-host
- SSH connections kept dropping
- Worried about data loss (confirmed data is safe)

**Current State Verified:**
- PostgreSQL: 3,319 customers, 12,868 orders ✅
- Line Items: 0 (never imported) ❌
- Products: 0 (never imported) ❌
- Artwork: 205 GB on local Mac, not uploaded ❌

**Session Continuity Solution Initiated:**
- Created this DAILY_TASK_LOG.md
- Planning session history auto-append
- VS Code automation improvements

---

### Day 9: November 29, 2025 (Saturday) - GitHub Copilot Workspace URL Clarification

**User Question:**
How to connect `https://printshop-pro--hypnotizedent.github.app/` to the main repo?

**Findings:**
- The URL format `<repo-name>--<owner>.github.app` is a **GitHub Copilot Workspace** URL
- The URL `printshop-pro--hypnotizedent.github.app` points to a repo named `printshop-pro`
- However, the actual repository is `printshop-os`, NOT `printshop-pro`
- Only one repo exists under this owner: `hypnotizedent/printshop-os`

**Correct GitHub Copilot Workspace URL:**
```
https://printshop-os--hypnotizedent.github.app/
```

**What is GitHub Copilot Workspace?**
- Cloud-based development environment that runs in your browser
- Automatically connected to the repository when you open it
- URL format: `https://<repo-name>--<owner>.github.app/`
- No separate "connection" needed - it IS connected to the repo automatically

**How to Access Copilot Workspace:**
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/hypnotizedent/printshop-os`
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select "Codespaces" tab
4. Click "Create codespace on main" (or use existing workspace)
5. Alternatively, navigate directly to: `https://printshop-os--hypnotizedent.github.app/`

**Key Point:** The `printshop-pro` in the original URL suggests either:
- A typo (should be `printshop-os`)
- A previous repository name that was renamed
- A different workspace that needs to be recreated for `printshop-os`
